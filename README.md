# Digital-thermostat-smart-radiator-and-indor-quality-air-detector
Components used: Arduino ESP 8266, two relays, DHT11 temperature sensor, power supply and SGP30 sensor.
An "smart radiator" was made from an old oil radiator that has a thermostat located on the radiator itself. The oil radiator does not "know" the information about the space heating, but the thermostat only has the role of regulating the temperature on the radiator itself. The user can see the temperature and humidity in the room on the application interface as well as enter the desired temperature at which the radiator will be lit. Since the oil radiator has two heating stages, the temperature can be entered separately when the heating will be switched on at both heating intensity levels. It can also switch off the automatic and manually switch on both heating stages separately.
