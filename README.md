An "smart radiator" was made from an old oil radiator that has a thermostat located on the radiator itself. The oil radiator does not "know" the information about the space heating, but the thermostat only has the role of regulating the temperature on the radiator itself. The user can see the temperature and humidity in the room on the application interface as well as enter the desired temperature at which the radiator will be lit. Since the oil radiator has two heating stages, the temperature can be entered separately when the heating will be switched on at both heating intensity levels. It can also switch off the automatic and manually switch on both heating stages separately.

Also the user can see the historical display of temperature and humidity measurements as well as when the radiator was running at what heating level. Since the power consumption of the radiator is known, it is very easy to show the electricity consumption of the radiator. In addition to adaptations, the existing system can also be mounted on various heating systems. Like any form of central heating, the system would in this case, depending on the temperature, drive a pump that pushes the hot medium into the radiators for a particular room in which the measurement is performed.
